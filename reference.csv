mask-border-repeat,"This property specifies how the images for the sides and the middle part of the mask image are scaled and tiled. The first keyword applies to the horizontal sides, the second one applies to the vertical ones. If the second keyword is absent, it is assumed to be the same as the first, similar to the CSS border-image-repeat property."
mask-border-slice,"This property specifies inward offsets from the top, right, bottom, and left edges of the mask image, dividing it into nine regions: four corners, four edges, and a middle. The middle image part is discarded and treated as fully transparent black unless the fill keyword is present. The four values set the top, right, bottom and left offsets in that order, similar to the CSS border-image-slice property."

min-width,Sets the minimum width of an element. It limits the width property to be not smaller than the value specified in min-width.
orphans,"In typography terms, an orphan is the first line of a paragraph that is left behind on the old page while the paragraph continues on the next. The orphans CSS property refers to the minimum number of lines in a block container that must be left at the bottom of the old page. This property is normally used to control how page breaks occur. This property only affects paged media such as print.
For example, if a paragraph can't fit on one page in its entirety it is split wherever it is possible. In this way single lines of a paragraph can appear on page before it continues on the next page. This is usually unwanted, so many word processors require at least two lines to be left on an old page, instead of one. You can give it either a positive number (where 2 is the default) or inherit.
Note that the orphan property does not generally affect non-paged media such as screen. However, browsers supporting both orphans and columns will apply the intended functionality to columns as well. Also, the property only affects block-level elements."
outline,"The CSS outline property is a shorthand property for setting one or more of the individual outline properties outline-style, outline-width and outline-color in a single rule. In most cases the use of this shortcut is preferable and more convenient.
Outlines differ from borders in the following ways: 	•	Outlines do not take up space, they are drawn above the content.
	•	Outlines may be non-rectangular. They are rectangular in Gecko/Firefox. Internet Explorer attempts to place the smallest contiguous outline around all elements or shapes that are indicated to have an outline. Opera draws a non-rectangular shape around a construct."
outline-color,"The outline-color property sets the color of the outline of an element. An outline is a line that is drawn around elements, outside the border edge, to make the element stand out."
outline-offset,The outline-offset property offsets the outline and draw it beyond the border edge.
overflow,"The overflow property controls how extra content exceeding the bounding box of an element is rendered. It can be used in conjunction with an element that has a fixed width and height, to eliminate text-induced page distortion."
overflow-style,Specifies the preferred scrolling methods for elements that overflow.
overflow-x,The overflow-x property is a specific case of the generic overflow property. It controls how extra content exceeding the x-axis of the bounding box of an element is rendered.
padding,"The padding optional CSS property sets the required padding space on one to four sides of an element. The padding area is the space between an element and its border. Negative values are not allowed but decimal values are permitted. The element size is treated as fixed, and the content of the element shifts toward the center as padding is increased.
The padding property is a shorthand to avoid setting each side separately (padding-top, padding-right, padding-bottom, padding-left)."
padding-bottom,"The padding-bottom CSS property of an element sets the padding space required on the bottom of an element. The padding area is the space between the content of the element and its border. Contrary to margin-bottom values, negative values of padding-bottom are invalid."
padding-left,"The padding-left CSS property of an element sets the padding space required on the left side of an element. The padding area is the space between the content of the element and its border. Contrary to margin-left values, negative values of padding-left are invalid."
padding-right,"The padding-right CSS property of an element sets the padding space required on the right side of an element. The padding area is the space between the content of the element and its border. Contrary to margin-right values, negative values of padding-right are invalid."
padding-top,"The padding-top CSS property of an element sets the padding space required on the top of an element. The padding area is the space between the content of the element and its border. Contrary to margin-top values, negative values of padding-top are invalid."
page-break-after,"The page-break-after property is supported in all major browsers. With CSS3, page-break-* properties are only aliases of the break-* properties. The CSS3 Fragmentation spec defines breaks for all CSS box fragmentation."
page-break-before,"The page-break-before property sets the page-breaking behavior before an element. With CSS3, page-break-* properties are only aliases of the break-* properties. The CSS3 Fragmentation spec defines breaks for all CSS box fragmentation."
page-break-inside,"Sets the page-breaking behavior inside an element. With CSS3, page-break-* properties are only aliases of the break-* properties. The CSS3 Fragmentation spec defines breaks for all CSS box fragmentation."
pause,The pause property determines how long a speech media agent should pause before and after presenting an element. It is a shorthand for the pause-before and pause-after properties.
pause-after,"The pause-after property determines how long a speech media agent should pause after presenting an element. It may be replaced by the shorthand property pause, which sets pause time before and after."
pause-before,"The pause-before property determines how long a speech media agent should pause before presenting an element. It may be replaced by the shorthand property pause, which sets pause time before and after."
perspective,"The perspective property defines how far an element is placed from the view on the z-axis, from the screen to the viewer.
Perspective defines how an object is viewed. In graphic arts, perspective is the representation on a flat surface of what the viewer's eye would see in a 3D space. (See Wikipedia for more information about graphical perspective and for related illustrations.)
The illusion of perspective on a flat surface, such as a computer screen, is created by projecting points on the flat surface as they would appear if the flat surface were a window through which the viewer was looking at the object. In discussion of virtual environments, this flat surface is called a projection plane."
perspective-origin,"The perspective-origin property establishes the origin for the perspective property. It effectively sets the X and Y position at which the viewer appears to be looking at the children of the element.
When used with perspective, perspective-origin changes the appearance of an object, as if a viewer were looking at it from a different origin. An object appears differently if a viewer is looking directly at it versus looking at it from below, above, or from the side. Thus, the perspective-origin is like a vanishing point.
The default value of perspective-origin is 50% 50%. This displays an object as if the viewer's eye were positioned directly at the center of the screen, both top-to-bottom and left-to-right. A value of 0% 0% changes the object as if the viewer was looking toward the top left angle. A value of 100% 100% changes the appearance as if viewed toward the bottom right angle."
